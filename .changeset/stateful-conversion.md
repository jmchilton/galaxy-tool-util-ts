Add stateful workflow conversion between native and format2 with tool-aware parameter coercion (booleans, numbers, arrays). Includes pre-conversion eligibility checks, subworkflow recursion, per-step status reporting, and schema-aware roundtrip validation that classifies benign artifacts (type coercion, stale keys) vs real differences.
